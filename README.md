NumberSwap
==========

Front end of Android app for exchanging contact info more easily than other apps do.

Made at a 12 hour hackathon (messy code, needs to be organized)

Instead of using NFC/having to bump phones/etc, this uses location services to find a phone that would like to swap with 
you, so the physical annoyances are removed.  You just have to be in the same general area.
