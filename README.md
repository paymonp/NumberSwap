NumberSwap
==========

Front end of Android app for exchanging contact info more easily than other apps do.

Made at our first hackathon (12 hours); it was pretty rushed at the end, so the code needs cleaning up.

Instead of using NFC/having to bump phones/etc, this uses location services to find a phone that would like to swap with 
you, so the physical annoyances are removed.  You just have to be in the same general area.
